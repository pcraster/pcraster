Aguila is visualisation software for spatio-temporal data. It can be used to visualise temporal, spatial and/or uncertain data and contains features to aid exploratory data analysis.

Aguila is the primary visualisation tool of the `PCRaster environmental modelling software`__, but since it can read data in various :ref:`formats <dataFormats>`, it can be used in combination with other modelling and GIS software.
